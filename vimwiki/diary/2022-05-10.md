										- useSWRInfinite hook is fetching duplicate data from backend:
											- This is a bug that I am struggling to sort out
											- Solution:
												- go back to the old method of using infinite scroll
									- Going back to old routes of using infinite scroll:
										- This infinite scrolling will be done in the All_links component
										- Import infinte scroll from react-infinte-scroll
										- create 2 useState variables:
											- one for skip
											- the other for keeping track of links
											- make sure to import useState at the top of the file
										- create a useEffect hook to grab the initial data from the data.js file in api
										- create a loadMore function to load more data for infinite scroll
										- copy and paste the listOfLinks function from [slug].js to All_links component
										- create a variable for keeping track of the length of the data being returned
										- commit after that
									- I have created a new file in the API directory called index2.jsx
									- Now it is time to reconfigure all code to make it easier to read
									- starting with All_links component
									- create a new directory called actionTypes:
										- create a file called apiCalls.jsx
										- create an export default function called apis
										- this directory is used for all of the logic from API directory
						- [X] Prepare for mock interview with CapeGemini:
						- [X] Make a vimwiki entry and google entry for tomorrow

	=== Interview prep: mock interview with CapeGemini ===
		- Star method for interviews:
			- What is the Star method?:
				- The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question
				- by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are describing
		- Typical question that can be asked:
			1. Tell me about a situation when you were apart of a team and how you solved the challenges:
				- Situation:
					- A few weeks ago I had a Hackerthon for a radio project
					- Called the other radio 
				- Task:
					- There were many bugs and issues in the project
					- that needed to be sorted out
					- the backend was written in Django using Python
					- the front end was written in react using JavaScript
				- Action:
					- We were a team of roughly about 8 people with 2 senior devs
					- I desicided to do the backend as I new a very little bit about Django
					- I was assisting one of the senior devs on this project
					- As non of us new much about Django we decided to rather spin up an express server
					- As it would be quicker and easier to setup, instead of figuring out what goes on in Django
				- Result:
					- All endpoints are now up and running locally
					- It was the first time that I had ever done swagger-ui
					- Swagger-ui has also now been implemented
					- As a way of seeing all endpoints in a new and readable manner
			2. Tell me about a person you've worked with who's had a great impact on you:
				- The person that has a great impact on me would be Lana
				- Person in charge of cyf Cape Town
				- I would thank her for inviting me into this fantastic organization
				- Before I started with cyf, I was never doing vid calls or chairing my own meetings
				- Since I have been with cyf I have learnt a lot
				- All of the interesting people that you meet is an absolute bonus
			3. What's been the most challenging problem you have faced and how did you solve it?:
				- Most challenging problem:
					- My current project is the most challenging problem to date
					- using nextjs and aws s3 buckets
				- How did I solve this challenge:
					- I started out by going through tutorials on aws to see how they did it
					- to see how I can get it up and running on express first
					- the next step was to pull that program apart to see how it works
					- then start on uploading to aws s3 bucket
					- once that is done, then i take next steps for deleting and downloading s3 items
