        - [X] Projects:
					- [X] personal-link-tracker:
						- [X] feat/admin-dashboard branch:
							- Haven't yet come up with a way of using Posting
							- reset this branch to last commit
							- What I am thinking of doing next?:
								- The problem that I am facing is that I can't do hooks inside of export const
								- so I need to do an export default from api to actionTypes and to actionCreators
								- in the actionCreators use useContext
								- to push data from backend to frontend
								- actionTypes will be used to fetch the data from backend
								- actionCreators will be responsible for storing data into useContext
								- which get pushed from actionTypes to actionCreators
								- What I am wanting to do?:
									- inside export default for index2.jsx in the API directory
									- create a helper function inside there for Posting
								- can now update quill category
								- created helper functions for actionTypes and actionCreators
							- Next steps?:
								- Need to create pagination for users that are in the database
								- and for admins in db
        - [X] Create a google and vimwiki entry
