- [X] Research more of freelancing platforms:
	- Doing research on Fiverr:

	- Updated my Company research google sheets

	- Added a link to the about me section
	- The link will take them to my dev portfolio
- [X] Continue with adding to my dev portfolio:
	- Created a new branch called  quotes and added the following to it
	- Changed the about section to famous quotes
	- Added 7 famous quotes by famous people using a carousel
	- merged the quotes branch with the master branch and pushed it to GitHub

	- Pushed all changes to AWS
- [X] Continue trying to get storing and retrieving images right:
	- todo list:
		- change the model of the db from saving the image as a string to base64
		- image was saving to a public folder on the express side, now saves straight to db
	- Problems:
		- So I need to get it right so that it stores to my db from react using base64 or multer
		- Then take that image and convert it back to an image from base64
		- Just found this website:
			- https://stackabuse.com/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-node-js/
	- Solution:
		- Grab the image on react
		- Convert image from react to base64
		- Send that converted image to express to store in the db as base64
		- Then grab image from express as base64 from db
		- convert base64 image to image on the react side
		- to actual image
	- Thought of converting to base64:
		- Take an image once grabbed from the input tag
		- store that image in useState
		- convert that image to base64
		- send that image to express to be stored in the db
		- grab that image from base64
		- send it to react to be converted from base64 to an image
