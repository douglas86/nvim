== Notes ==
 - fedsa_mentoring session:
	 - Basics on javascript
	 - now got a sponsor code_capsules
	 - dynamically typed language
	 - what that means is that it is not bound to a specific type
	 - do not use var, the problem is that it makes your variable accessible thought your program
	 - only use let or const
	 - only use const when you don't want to change your variable in your program
	 - use let when ever you want to reassign a variable
