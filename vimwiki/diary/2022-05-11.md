            - [X] Mock interview with Capgemini @14:00
						- [X] Capgemini Digital Experience Insight Session @16:00

        === Today's notes ===
            - [X] Personal Projects:
							- [X] feat/admin-dashboard branch:
								- Bug:
									- All_Links.jsx file:
										- returns an infinite amount of links: solved
										- when the variable pag gets called i can't seem to access data from that variable
								- Warnings:
									- Failed prop type: The prop 'children' is marked as required in 'InfiniteScroll', but its vale is 'undefined':
										- This warning has disappeared
										- it could of been the hasMore attribute of InfiniteScroll
								- busy with code reformatting:
									- Index2.jsx:
										- Busy with getting data send from this file to All_Links.jsx file
										- When I try console.log is returns undefined
								- What is the plan from now:
									- Place the pagination in the API directory in the index2.jsx file
									- Every time I want to use pagination this gets called
									- Problem:
										- It fetches data from back end to index2.jsx
										- but, it doesn't send data to All_Links.jsx file
										- pagination in All_Links.jsx, is i console.log that it says undefined
										- This problem has been solved
								- Problem for tomorrow:
									- create a new file for all helper functions 
									- starting with All_Links and My_Links file
									- after that take the data file and break that up
									- create two new directories inside of the api directory:
										- first one called controllers: this is where the logic will sit
										- second one called servers: this is for all helper functions
						- [X] Prepare for Mock interview:
							- Go over the question from below
							- maybe even adding to them
						- [X] Create a google calendar and vimwiki entry for tomorrow

	=== Interview prep: mock interview with Capgemini ===
		==== This is notes on the situation ====
			- Star method for interviews:
				- What is the Star method?:
					- The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question
					- by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are describing
			- Typical question that can be asked:
				1. Tell me about a situation when you were apart of a team and how you solved the challenges:
					- Situation:
						- A few weeks ago I had a Hackathon for a radio project
						- Called the other radio 
					- Task:
						- There were many bugs and issues in the project
						- that needed to be sorted out
						- the back end was written in django using Python
						- the front end was written in react using JavaScript
					- Action:
						- We were a team of roughly about 8 people with 2 senior devs
						- I decided to do the back end as I new a very little bit about Django
						- I was assisting one of the senior devs on this project
						- As non of us new much about Django we decided to rather spin up an express server
						- As it would be quicker and easier to setup, instead of figuring out what goes on in Django
					- Result:
						- All endpoints are now up and running locally
						- It was the first time that I had ever done swagger-ui
						- Swagger-ui has also now been implemented
						- As a way of seeing all endpoints in a new and readable manner
				2. Tell me about a person you've worked with who's had a great impact on you:
					- The person that has a great impact on me would be Lana
					- Person in charge of cyf Cape Town
					- I would thank her for inviting me into this fantastic organization
					- Before I started with cyf, I was never doing vid calls or chairing my own meetings
					- Since I have been with cyf I have learnt a lot
					- All of the interesting people that you meet is an absolute bonus
				3. What's been the most challenging problem you have faced and how did you solve it?:
					- Most challenging problem:
						- My current project is the most challenging problem to date
						- using nextjs and aws s3 buckets
					- How did I solve this challenge:
						- I started out by going through tutorials on aws to see how they did it
						- to see how I can get it up and running on express first
						- the next step was to pull that program apart to see how it works
						- then start on uploading to aws s3 bucket
						- once that is done, then i take next steps for deleting and downloading s3 items
