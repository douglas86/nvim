				- Deployed to netlify on the 24 May 2021
				- Made some notes on the topic
			- [X] Deploying front-end to netlfiy and back-end to heroku:
				- Create a new react and express app on your local machine
				- Create a new GitHub repo
				- Test the front end and the back end separately
				- Create a new .gitignore file in server.js to ignore node_modules and keys.js
				- Delete .git inside of the client directory:
					- $ rm -rf .git
				- Initialize a new Github repo on your local machine
				- add and commit the new git repo
				- start with setting up netlify for deployment with the following commands on your local machine:
					- cd client
					- npm run build
					- cd build
					- netlify sites:create
					- netlify link
						- There will be a list of options to choose from
						- I chose the third one
						- choose from a list of your recently updated sites
					- netlify deploy
						- This will deploy the netlify app as a draft
						- to see if you are happy with the results
					- netlify deploy -p
						- This will deploy the site live
						- for the hole world to see
				- Then we need to setup netlify on the website for continuous deployment:
					- Login to netlify on the web browser:
						- type netlify into the web browser
						- it is normally the first link that is displayed
					- once you are on the home page you should see all your sites at the bottom
					- click on the one that you just created via the terminal
					- there will be a tab that says Deploys next to site overview
					- click on Deploys
					- click on the button that says deploy settings
					- there will be a group of items on the lift hand side
					- click on the one that says continuous deployment
					- click on the button that says link site to Git
					- click on the one that says Github
					- this will authorize netlify to use your GitHub repo
					- search for the repo that you want to connect to github
					- in this case it was called test
					- click on the button that says Deploy site
					- A hole bunch of stuff will run in the terminal
					- once that is done
					- click on Deploy agains next to site overview
					- make sure that you are on the tab that says build & deploy
					- if you scroll down there will be a button that says Edit settings
					- click on edit settings
					- change the following settings:
						- change your Base directory to client
						- change your Build command to npm run build
						- change your Publish directory to client/build
						- then click the save button at the bottom
					- then go back to the Deploys tab next to site overview
					- there will be a dropdown menu called trigger deploys
					- click on the one that says Clear cache and deploy site
					- if everything went ok you can click on preview and it will show you the site in a new tab
			- next is setting up heroku for Deployment:
				- login to heroku from the terminal:
					- $ heroku login
				- create a Procfile inside of the server directory
				- place the following one line in the Procfile:
					- web: npm start
					- this tells heroku how to start
					- make sure that nodemon is in one of the dependencies in package.json file
				- create a new heroku app:
					- heroku create
				- next we need to push a subdirectory to heroku
				- the reson for a subdirectory is that we have two directory
				- residing in our git repo
				- so we need to push only the server directory to heroku using the following command:
					- $ git subtree push --prefix server heroku master
