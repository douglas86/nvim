			- All bugs had disappeared
			- Used flex-wrap to wrap Project cards
			- Created a new Page called projects.js

== Minutes of meetings ==

	=== fedsa mentoring session ===
		- Plan is to working on short courses
		- What are blockers:
			- Having no experience
			- How do you progress
		- If you planning on getting work, make sure that it is in the language that you want a job in
		- Always do a components folder
		- Always try and use jsx extensions
		- When doing a page create a pages folder with all the pages in there
		- when creating a components keep all your files together
		- airbnb is one of the guides when it comes to coding styles
		- The team lead is the one that will tell you how to style your components
		- Don't have to use import React every time
		- Creating a variable outside of your app, means that that variable will only run once
		- Never use the index
		- Must have a unique index
		- doing a try, except and finally block
		- this will wait for when all data is loaded for it to render
		- In the new year, are hoping to do courses that will gear you up for making you job ready
		- This is the last session for the year
