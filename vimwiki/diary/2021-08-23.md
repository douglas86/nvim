== Notes ==
 === Fedsa mentoring @17:00 ===
 - When you want to import with just js script:
	 - type="module" in the js script that was imported into your html document
 - forEach has a nicer look than a for loop
 - forEach doesn't return anything
 - forEach just loops through each item
 - map will actually return the item when it loops through it
 - note: it is always like a one to one mapping
 - the way that filter works if it is true returns it, if false exudes it
 - reduce has one accumulator
 - with the accumulator you can do anything that you want with the value
 - passing in the [] as the second parameter in reduce it tells js that the accumulator is an array
