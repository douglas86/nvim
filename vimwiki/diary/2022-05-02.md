										- [X] feat/user-dashboard branch:
											- Bugs:
												- Prisma studio bug:
													- Error: Unknown binaryTarget debian-openssl-3.0.x and no custom binaries were provided
													- made some notes in libreoffice on how to fix
												- Warning:
													- Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `crossOrigin`.
													- deleted crossOrigin from link tag in __document.js_
												- Update section for dashboard for user:
													- If there is only one category and the checkbox is ticked to false it disappears
													- Sorted bug out
													- gathered information from db on all categories
													- passed it as props to Subscriber
													- then stored it to useContext
													- gathering all data when update component is loaded
												- Got a new bug with context based on above input:
													- Warning: cannot update a component SubscriberProvider
													- Instead of sending data to update component as a prop
													- Categories was already being sent to that prop
													- so i just tapped into that
											- Updating links:
												- As soon as Update button is clicked an alert pops up to ask if you are sure?
												- That data will then be sent to the backend /api/link endpoint with the method of PUT
												- The PUT method needs to be created in the link.js file
												- create a function in update component called handleSubmit
												- handleSubmit function:
													- use fetch with the method of PUT using the state as the body of data to be sent
													- on successful update send res.json back with status 200 and message
													- on status 200 reload page
											- This branch is now finished
											- main branch is ahead of this branch
											- merge main branch into this branch
											- sorted out merge conflicts
											- Create a pr for this branch to be merged with main
										- [X] feat/admin-dashboard branch:
											- This is a new branch, so needs to be created first
											- Create a new tab called links:
												- create two radio buttons:
													- one radio button for all links
													- the other button for links that I have created
												- all links radio button:
													- when this radio button is checked it is responsible for loading all links in the db
													- gather all link document from db and console.log it
										- [X] What needs to be done next:
											- [X] Continue with feat/admin-dashboard branch:
												- Busy with the links tag 
												- When all Links radio button is selected
												- Gathers all links in db for displaying on Screen using Alert from react-bootstrap
												- On that Alert component there must be a delete and update for that particular link
												- On the My Links radio button
												- It will display all links pertaining to the links that I have created
												- With an update and delete on that Alert component
