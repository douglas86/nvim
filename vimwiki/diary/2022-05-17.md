            - [X] Meeting with Barny from cyf employment @11:00

        === Today's notes ===
            - [X] Personal Projects:
							- [X] personal link tracker:
								- [X] feat/admin-dashboard branch:
									- Reformate pagination endpoint:
										- Starting from All_Links component:
											- What I am wanting to test:
												- pass only a true or false value into pagination component
												- take out the endpoints prop
											- Starting:
												- Send user to backend with true or false
												- Test is user it not sent to see if it is undefined
												- Start by grabing original data from data.js
											- Resetted my progress, needing to start from overs
											- What I am wanting to do?:
												- I am wanting to sort out the pagination component
												- Taking All_Links component to sort out first:
													- What I am wanting to do?:
														- because, it is for all links in db
														- I don't have any props to pass
														- the endpoint will be the same for all paginations
														- comment out all code in pagination component
														- create 3 states in pagination component:
															- skip
															- links
															- len
														- When pagination component is first loaded it needs to populate the links state
														- I have now done it that I only need to pass a prop as user
														- if i need data on that user
												- Next steps:
													- needing to implement pagination through out
													- list all components that use pagination:
														- All_Links
														- My_Links
														- [slug].js
													- now I have to get pagination working with [slug].js:
														- can now load slug between if it is undefined or not
														- Bugs:
															- Problem: solved
																- when telling it to take two it doesn't want to load the rest
																- it just says undefined for len in pagination component
															- Problem:
																- it is now retreiving duplicate amounts
																- my thinking is that it does that with uneven numbers in db
							- [X] creating my own snippets:
								- created a new snippet for export default 
								- called exd
								- which takes the name of the file a capitilizes it
								- using python interpolation
						- [X] Reloading content on my laptop:
							- I got my laptop back from incredible connection 
							- It was a faulty hard drive, only had 60% health
							- incredible connection replaced hard drive with a 240gig ssd
							- total price of service: R1298
							- Which includes:
								- system diagnosis
								- replace 500gig hard drive with 240gig ssd
								- labour
								- type c to usd cable
							- Reloaded pop os
							- Busy with reinstalling all required software
							- generated a new ssh key for Github
							- installed snap from cli
							- installed neovim from snap packages
							- reinstalled nvim from my Github repo
							- installed vim-plug
							- and ran :PlugInstall to install all plugins
							- had to git clone nerd fonts seperately as it is to big for vim-plug
							- once nerd-fonts is installed:
								- cd into nerd-fonts directory
								- then run ./install.sh
								- to install all needed dependencies
								- then install node
								- sudo apt install node
								- once done install all node dependencies
								- npm install
							- Install all that is needed for coc.nvim:
								- when you enter nvm
								- it will install all needed plugins according to the install settings in coc-settings.json
						- [ ] Create a google and vimwiki entry for tomorrow:
							- What I need to include in the entries:
								- Write an email to David at Starling Bank:
									- Details are in the slack message that I received from Alec at cyf
									- What needs to be included in the message:
										- Github link for profile page
