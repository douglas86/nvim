    === Notes: Docker ===
			- commands:
				- docker: this will give you a list of all available commands in docker
				- flags for container command:
					- -f: this is used with the rm command to forcefully remove a container even if it is still running
					- --help: gives a list on all container commands
					- --name: this you can specify the name of the container
				- docker container exec -it: run additional command in existing container
				- docker container inspect: details of one container
				- docker container logs webhost: this is to see the logs of that container, webhost is the name of the image
				- docker container ls: this shows all running containers
				- docker container rm #unique_id: this is the remove the image in questioned, if you use -f before #unique_id it will forcefully remove it
				- docker container run -it: start new container interactively
				- docker container stats: this command show the stats of the images that are running, it will also show cpu usage
				- docker container stop #unique_id: this will stop the container #unique_id is the container id you only need to enter a few commands for it to be unique
				- docker container top: process list in one container
				- docker info: to see information on docker
				- docker version: to see what version of docker you are running
			- What are Containers:
				- Containers are the fundamental building blocks in docker
			- Starting an Nginx web server:
				- docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
					- Downloaded image 'nginx' from Docker Hub
					- Started a new container from that image
					- Opened port 80 on the host IP
					- Routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80
			- Differences between images and Containers:
				- an image is the app we want to run
				- a Container is an instance of that image running as a process
				- You can have many containers running off the same image
			- What happens in docker container run:
				- Looks for that image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything
				- then look in remote image repository
				- downloads the latest version
				- creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
				- gives it a virtual ip on a private network
				- opens up port 80 on host 
				- starts container 
			- Assignment: Manage multiple containers:
				- docs.docker.com and --help are your friend
				- Run a nginx, a mysql, and a httpd (apache) server
				- Run all of them --detach (or -d), name them with --name
				- nginx should listen on 80:80, http on 8080:80, mysql on 3306:3306
				- when running mysql, use the --env option (or -e) to pass in MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
				- use docker container logs on mysql to find the random password it created on startup
				- clean it all up with docker container stop and docker container rm (both can accept multiple names or ID's)
				- use docker container ls to ensure everything is correct before and after cleanup
			- Whats going on in Containers:
				- docker container top: process list in one container
				- docker container inspect: details of one container config
				- docker container stats: performance stats for all container
			- Docker Networks: Concepts:
				- review of docker container run -p
				- for local dev/testing, networks usually 'just work'
				- quick port check with docker container port <container>
				- understand how network packets move around Docker
			- Docker Networks Default:
				- each container connected to a private virtual network 'bridge'
				- each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
				- all containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without -p
				- Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app:
					- network 'my_web_app' for mysql and php/apache containers
					- network 'my_api' for mongo and nodejs containers
				- Batteries included, but removable
				- make new virtual networks
				- attach containers to more then one virtual network
				- skip virtual networks and use host IP
			- Docker networks: cli management
