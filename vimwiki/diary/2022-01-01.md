		- test: binary gap
		- Total score: 26%
		- Solution that I found for the test:
			function getGaps(BinaryArray, gaps) {
			  const firstOne = BinaryArray.indexOf("1");
			  if (firstOne > -1) {
				let NewBinarayArray = BinaryArray.slice(firstOne + 1);
				let secondOne = NewBinarayArray.indexOf("1");
				// gaps = [];
				if (secondOne > 0) {
				  gaps.push(secondOne);
				}
				return getGaps(NewBinarayArray.slice(secondOne + 1), gaps);
			  }
			  return gaps.length > 0 ? Math.max.apply(Math, gaps) : 0;
			}

			export default function solution(N) {
			  if (N === parseInt(N, 10) && N >= 1 && N <= 2147483647) {
				const Binary = N.toString(2).split("");
				return getGaps(Binary, []);
			  }
			  return 0;
			}

			console.log(solution(9))
	- [X] Fedsa course:
		- There was a slight bug that i was having:
			- every time I clicked on the heart or cart it was storing to a json file
			- it would only update the data every time it had to build the app
		- So what I did instead was store it to useContext
		- Updated useContext on every button click
