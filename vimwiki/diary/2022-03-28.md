== Daily Tasks ==
        - [X] video calls:
                - [X] No video calls
        - [o] Today's notes:
                - [X] Visit Suzuki South:
												- [X] Repairs:
																- [X] Dashboard cover is cracked and needs replacing
																- [X] Find info on getting seat cover repaired:
																				- Name of a place to fix and repair seat cover: Sport Equip: 021 511 0522
												- [X] Accessories needed for servicing:
																- [X] 1 litre motorbike oil 20w40
																- [X] Spark plug
																- [X] wheel dampeners (4 rubber objects that sit in the housing of the drum of the back wheel)
								- [X] Motorbike:
												- [X] Replace Odometer assembly
												- [X] Check and lubricate chain
								- [o] Submit link branch:
												- [X] Alert must appear when data is received from back end
												- [X] Run a check to make sure that all data in form is filled in before sending it to back end:
																- [X] if data is not filled in alert pop ups: This alert can run on front end
																- [X] if data is filled in send to back
												- [X] Merge branch with Category-details branch
												- [ ] Merged branch from Category-details branch:
																- The reason for this merge is to alter the getServerSideProps
																- I need to allow for retrieving of links from db based on category for page
								- [o] Category-details branch:
												- [X] Create at least 10 links in the node category for storing in db
												- [X] Display all links in the category for node section
												- [X] Merge branch with Submit-link branch:
																- Reason for doing this is that when posting link to db 
																- I sort of need two posting methods
																- One for posting links to db
																- the other for grabbing partial links from db
												- [ ] Once data can be displayed only get links of categories that the page is for:
																- Create an array, this array is used for storing the links from db
																- Grab links from db, sift through the category array from db
																- If it has the slug that you are looking for then return a partial array
																- The partial array will work on mouse wheel variable
												- [ ] Create a variable that keeps track of mouse wheel:
																- when browser page hits bottom
																- variable changes by 2
																- that cycle needs to be repeated until the end of the links from db
												- [ ] 
								- [ ] Create a vimwiki entry for tomorrow
        - [ ]
