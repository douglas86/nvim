        === Today's notes ===
            - [X] Personal Projects:
							- [X] personal link tracker:
								- [X] feat/admin-dashboard branch:
									- Bug:
										- Pagination.jsx file:
											- Problem:
												- When scolling down it still seems to want to load more
												- it is loading two extra docs which are duplicates of what is there
												- as it gets to the end it seems to jump a little bit
									- What I am wanting to do with the pagination for All_Links and My_Links?:
										- Create a pagination.jsx file inside of components directory:
											- This file will be responside for all infinite loading through out the projects
											- Passing in two props into the component:
												- The first prop is the endpoint
												- The second prop is the user:
													- passing in the word true or false
													- true being that you only want data based on the logged in user
													- false being that you want all data not only logged in user
										- Create two new directories in the api directory:
											- controllers:
												- controllers is used for all of the logic of the endpoints
												- created logic for length of docs
												- and findMany for docs using prisma
											- services:
												- services is used as helper functions for the controllers methods
												- created helper functions for length of docs
												- and findMany for docs using prisma
									- Sorting out pagination through out the project:
										- Find out what components call the pagination.js file
										- [slug].jsx is the next file to be sorted out:
											- using the pagination component
											- pass in the slug
										- Whats the next step:
											- need to get slug to back end in the data.js file
											- gather all data in db concerning slug
						- [X] Create a google calendar entry for Monday
