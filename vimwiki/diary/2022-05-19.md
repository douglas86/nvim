								- [X] feat/admin-dashboard branch:
									- I am just wanting to make some notes:
										- I was struggling to get a to use Posting with react hooks
										- so create a export default function called Posting in index.jsx file in the actionTypes directory
										- then create a helper directory called actionCreators
										- in that directory create a file called Posted which will be an export default function
										- reason being is that I need to use react hooks, can only use react hooks with export default
										- using Posing export const to fetch the data from backend
										- once data has been fetched will send data to Posted helper function for storing in useContext
