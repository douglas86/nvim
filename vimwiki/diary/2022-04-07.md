        - [.] Today's notes:
								- [ ] Postgres:
												- What is Postgres? 
																- It is a highly stable database management system, 
																- backed by more than 20 years of community development which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. 
																- PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.
												- How do you install Postgres?
																- First, execute the following command to create the file repository configuration:
																				- sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
																- Second, import the repository signing key:
																				- wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
																- Third, update the package list:
																				- sudo apt-get update
																- Finally, install the latest version of PostgreSQL:
																				- sudo apt-get install postgresql
												- To connect to PostgreSQL using the postgres role, you switch over to the postgres account on your server by typing:
																- sudo -i -u postgres
																- At the prompt type psql, this will then enter the psql prompt
												- Commands used with psql:
																- quit command: \q
																- create db: create database dvdrental;
																				- dvdrental is the name of the database
																- list all users with roles in db command: \du
																- create a new user as a superuser command: CREATE USER douglas SUPERUSER;
																				- douglas is the name of the superuser to be created
                - [ ] Docker Compose:
												- What is the difference between docker and docker compose?
																- You might heard of Docker-compose. 
																- The difference between Docker and Docker-compose is simple: 
																- docker commands are focused on only one container (or image) at once while docker-compose manage several containers docker
												- How do you install docker compose?
																- Run this command to install the current stable release
																				- sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
																- Run this command to make the binary executable
																				- sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
																- Check to see if it has been installed correctly
																				- docker-compose --version
												- Getting started:
																- create 3 files:
																				- $ touch Dockerfile
																				- $ touch docker-compose.yml
																				- $ touch .dockerignore
																- Go onto google seach and type: docker hub
																- it should be the first link that pops up:
																				- https://hub.docker.com/
																- scroll down on that page and it will show you all docker images that can be installed
																- Dockerfile:
																				- This file is responsible for all images
																				- In this tutorial i will be using nodejs and postgres
																				- In that file place the following line:
																								- FROM node:alpine
																												- node is the name of the image
																												- alpine is the version that you are wanting to use with this image
																								- WORKDIR		/usr/src/app
																												- this is the working directory of our application
																								- COPY package*.json .
																												- then you need to copy all package files to the current working directory
																												- dot at the end means current directory
																												- which in this case is /usr/src/app
																								- RUN npm ci
																												- then you need to install all dependencies
																												- ci basically means continuous integration
																								- COPY . .
																												- this basically means copy each and every file from this directory to the working directory
																								- CMD ["npm", "start"]
																												- this command is used to start your application
																- .dockerignore: this is for all files that you want docker to ignore
																				- ./node_modules
																				- Dockerfile
																				- .dockerignore
																				- docker-compose.yml
																- docker-compose.yml: this file is responsible for starting all images within docker
																				- version: "3.9"
																								- this is the version of docker-compose that I am using
																				- services:
																								- # postgres services
																												- the # symbol is used for adding comments
																								- postgres_db:
																												- this is for giving the services a name
																												- image: postgres:latest
																																- then you have to provide an image under postgres_db
																																- postgres is the name of the image
																																- latest is the version
																												- restart: always
																																- if for some reason the container fails it will auto restart
																												- volumes:
																																- /private/var/lib/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql
																																- this is used for where you want to install the postgres data
																																- make sure that under volumes you place /private etc as is including the dash
																								- # Node api services
																								- api:
																												- this is the name of the other service
																												- this service i am going to use for node
																												- build: .
																																- since we specified all build information in the Dockerfile file
																																- the . means that Dockerfile is in the same directory as yml
