== Notes ==
	=== Justin Slack on Introduction to Web Typography ===
	- Start here:
		- Choosing a typeface
		- Font categories:
			- Serif
			- Sans-serif
			- monospace
			- Script
		- Serif:
			- Feet or non-structural details at the ends of some strokes
		- Sans-serif:
			- Literally without feet
		- Function and form:
			- Relationship between letters and content
		- Which is better:
			- who knows
		- Clear and recognisable:
			- Each letter should have a distintive shape
			- open forms
			- clear terminals
			- letterform contrast
		- One or more?:
			- Most of the time can get away with one family and variants
			- As a project grows you might need an appropriate typographic response to complexity
		- Glyphs:
			- Does a typeface have all the required glyphs with correctly designed diacritic marks?
			- Does it have correctly designed open type features like accents, fractions, small caps and so on?
		- Digital type:
			- In 1983 apple released lisa, the first computer with a graphical user interface
			- Previously the main area of research in digital type had been for print
			- Core fonts for the web was started by microsoft 1996
			- the font wars:
				- apple advanced typography
				- adobe type 1 postscript
				- true type microsoft and apple
				- open type adobe and microsoft:
					- open type will give us a lot more type of fonts
			- Fonts in the browser:
				- this is made possible by @font-face
				- The first browser to support custom fonts was netscape navigator 4 in 1994
			- All these fonts are supported by woff:
				- Web open font format
				- Developed by mozilla in 2009
				- Adopted as standard in 2012
				- 2015 woff2 30% reduction
		- Font loading:
			- before a browser can show a web font it needs to be downloaded over the network
			- the download is only initiated once the browser detects the font family in the css file
		- foit - flash of invisible text:
		- fout - flash of unstyled text
		- What can we do:
			- dont use custom fonts
		- minimise downloads:
			- look for a local versions installed
		- Download earlier:
			- get around this by using a pre load, via a link tag in the head
		- font display:
			- How does it work?:
				- the font display on a timeline
		- Part two:
			- css properties for type
			- open type features
			- responsive typegraphy
