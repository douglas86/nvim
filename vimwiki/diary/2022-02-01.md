			- It is sitting at 30% done
			- Hope to finish it by end of February
		- Started reworking some of the code from my Udemy course in another github repo:
			- This is to implement prisma with nextjs
		- Helping the Scotland class 5 team out with final projects:
			- Having a retro every Tuesday and Thursday
			- As well as having video calls with one of the students:
				- On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
				- From 8am to 10am
			- Sometimes over the retro I even stay on with helping out the students are TA to sort out tech problems
		- Given codewars a bit of a break until the end of cyf final projects
