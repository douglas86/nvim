        - [X] Today's notes:
                - [X] The other radio hackerthon project:
									- What still needs to be done:
										- Need to display different models at the bottom
									- What has been done:
										- This data was added to the swagger.json file
										- Added a reference at the end of each endpoint
										- this reference is to link to the models
										- have added the following models:
											- episode
											- news
											- emails
											- shows
								- [X] personal-link-tracker:
									- what still needs to be done:
										- Create the delete and update button on the link alert document
										- As soon as Delete is clicked popup display's to confirm
										- if confirm is clicked it needs to delete
										- and that is were I left it
										- update still needs to be implemented
									- what has been done:
										- I have created content in the index.jsx for subscriber Dashboard
										- All that content has to be placed into a read.jsx file
										- reason being is that I need to useContext to switch between components
										- place all useState and useEffect in useContext
										- create an onSubmit file for all standalone functions which include:
											- loadMore
											- handleDelete
											- handleUpdate (for now this will just update the form state when clicked)
										- what needs to be done:
											- create the basic template for the form to be populated
											- create form and populate it with state data from context
											- once form is created create update button
											- this update button will send all data to db to be updated
											- once update button has been clicked it refreshes page
