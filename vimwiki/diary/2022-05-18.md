									- What I am needing to sort out?:
										- I am needing to sort out pagination
										- Thought on pagination?:
											- There are currently three components that use pagination:
												- All_Links
												- My_Links
												- [slug].js
											- All_Links component:
												- in order for this one to use pagination
												- it doesn't need any props
											- My_Links component:
												- in order for this one to use pagination
												- it needs one prop
												- that prop being that it needs to send true
												- for user
												- to say that you want all links based on the current logged in user
											- [slug].js component:
												- in order for this one to use pagination
												- it needs one prop
												- i need to send the slug to the back end
												- to grab all links on that category name
										- I need to run 3 checks:
											- i can use an else if statement
											- first if statement checks if the user prop is true
											- if true then gather all data from db on the links of the user
											- else if statement will check if the slug is not undefined
											- if slug is not undefined then it will gather all data on the slug in db
											- else statement will gather all data if the user and slug prop is undefined
											- this gathers all data on all links
										- Start by the pagination component:
											- comment out all code
											- it takes in two props user and slug
											- the user prop will only pass in the value of true if i need it there
											- the slug prop will pass in a value of the name i want to draw from db
											- start off by declaring two useState variables:
												- skip - number of documents to skip
												- links - documents to use a map on
												- len - length of the document
											- a useEffect hook is needed to make a call as soon as prop is loaded
											- this is also responsible for populating the initial data in links state
										- data.js:
											- this is where the if else statement will take place
											- there will be 2 files linked to this file:
												- dataControllers.js - this is responsible for all the logic
												- dataServices.js - this is for all the helper functions
											- dataControllers.js:
												- created 3 functions:
													- Get - this is responsible for getting all links within db
													- GetUser - this is responsible for getting all links based on that user
													- GetSlug - this is responsible for getting links only for that particular category
											- dataServices.js:
												- create a helper function for the length of the documents
												- this Len function will take in two parameters
												- the first parameter will be the query:
													- which could either be skip or slug
												- the second on is the req:
													- this is used to get the logged in user
									- sort out index.js file in the API directory:
										- Take all code from this file and place in into index2.jsx
										- change all imports to reflect this change
										- i will have to come back to this
									- next is to sort out the admin Dashboard:
										- instead of calling create, read, update
										- rename it to tabs so for example i shall call it CreateCategoryTab
										- but CreateCategoryTab will be the name of the directory to be drawn every time i need it
										- in that directory it will have an index file
										- create 4 tabs category directories with each one having an index file:
											- CreateCategoryTab
											- AllCategoriesTab
											- UpdateCategoriesTab
											- LinksTab
										- This category directories are responsible for the entire tab
										- Sorting out all components to where they should be deleting unnecessary comps:
											- included everything from Create component to index.jsx in CreateCategoryTab
											- Deleted the Create component in Admin Dashboard
											- Deleted the Read component in Admin Dashboard
											- Deleted the Update component in Admin Dashboard
											- Will come back to the links directory for LinksTab
										- Sorting out AllCategoriesTab first:
											- created an export const for Get routes
											- and a helper function for that route in actionTypes directory
										- Busy with trying to find out how to use Posting as a export const function
										- I can't use hooks inside of export const so have to go back to original plan
										- export default with mini functions
						- [ ] Create a google and vimwiki entry for tomorrow
