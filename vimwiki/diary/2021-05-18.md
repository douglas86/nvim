== Todo List ==
	
	=== Today's tasks ===
		- [X] video calls:

					- Didn't get a chance to ask questions
				- This meeting finished @17:00
		- [ ] Sort out things for Edu Students:
			- Clone the first react project to desktop to GitHub
			- Ryan's work:
				- Have a look at his pr for the TV project:
					- Your images seem to be a bit squashed, when being displayed on screen
					- Normally when you are programming you don't ever do a file as long as 300 lines of code, it becomes to complicated to maintain.
					- But I wouldn't worry to much about that, as you mite deal more with this in React
					- Some of the other students work that I have looked at they can't seem to sort out the 0 in front of the 10, good job in getting that sorted out.
					- Maybe try and add a bit more formatting, like bootstrap cards
					- I will place this as a comment on your pr for TV show project.
			- Add another tab to student marking document:
				- for React, try adding all three weeks
		- [ ] 

	=== Problematic tasks ===
		- Storing images from react to express:
			- Project that i am using directory name: multer&react
			- Can send images from react to express using the original name of the file
			- If you try sending the same file again with the same name it just replaces the image with that name
			- Next task:
				- Save items to the db
				- Then draw from db to display on screen in react
