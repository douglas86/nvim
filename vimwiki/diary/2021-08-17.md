== Notes ==
	* Notes on PowerPoint presentation:
		1. Home page:
			- Starting on the home page
			- There will be three sections
			- The header section at the top with the
			- The logo of the company on the left 
			- and the Google signIn/Register on the right
			- There will be a body section just under the header
			- with basic information of who the company is and what they do
			- Just under that will be the Footer section
			- with basic contact details for if they want to get into contact with you
		2. Home page Flowchart diagram:
			- this flowchart diagram is just a step by step approach
			- to the homepage
			- with the arrows showing the process or steps to take
		3. Google Login:
			- This is just a brief idea of how the different pages are going to look
			- on the left would be a simple google login form
			- top right would be your loading page
			- bottom right would be the data that will be stored in the database
		4. Diagram on roles in database:
			- if for some reason there was a google failed login
			- it would keep you on homepage and give you a notification
			- as soon as somebody has successfully logged into google
			- a Loading page will be displayed
			- I had thought of having two roles for the database:
				- The admin role
				- and the rider role
		5. Diagram of google signIn/Register:
			- if there is a successfully login and it is first time to site
			- will register him as a rider by default
			- if it is second time to site
			- will look up role in db
			- if admin will display admin page
			- if rider will display rider page
		6. This is sort of the idea that I had for an admin page:
			- adding new admin in the dropdown menu on the top left
			- with a toggle just next to it to select between admin and rider dashboard
			- with the price per week next to that
			- and how much will be paid after 18 months
			- the dashboard just below is the riders information with the following categories
			- the dashboard below that will be the admins information with the corresponding categories
			- these dashboards will change depending on what toggle you are on
		7. Diagram to show the step in the designing process of the admin page:
		8. This is the idea that i had for the rider page:
			- the rider will have the basic information of him on the left
			- with the image to be uploaded on the right
			- and the kilometers from image above just under that
			- there will be a save button just under that to save it to database
		9. Diagram showing the step by step approach of the rider page:
		11. The end
