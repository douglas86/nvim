	- Directory name that I am working from: Image upload
	- I got this right following the following tutorial:
		- https://www.positronx.io/react-file-upload-tutorial-with-node-express-and-multer/
		- This tutorial was done using class components
		- I then converted those class components to functional components
	- I got it to store an image from react to express
	- It also stores the a link a the db
	- saving the images to the public folder in express
	- Next step:
		- Save images directly from react to express without the use of a folder
		- Save images using multer
		- It is saving data as a url, needs to be saved as a base64
		- With the name of the image
		- Grab images from db
		- and send them to react to be displayed on the screen
