- the guide to the ultimate cv
- How to wright a great cv
- Why are we here?:
	- The job market have changed
	- Sometimes some jobs have a lot of applications can have upto 1000 applications or more
	- Don't believe in a scatted application approach
	- Believe in quality rather than quantity
- Talk about cv's today:
	- Part One: Common mistakes when people right cv's:
		- Using one cv for every job
		- A hiring manager or recruiter will be looking for very specific experience or skills
		- Create a cv tailored to the specific job
		- Don't use buzzwords and clitches
		- Focusing on what you did, and including in the details in what you did
		- Most cv applications are done through a computer, but it will focus more on the skills
		- Use the following formula when righting a cv
		- In Situation(S), I performed Action(A), which led to Results(R).
		- Wasting space with exec summary
		- On a cv the most popular space is above the fold
		- Making too long
		- Most employers or recruiters might spend 10 - 60 seconds skimming through your CV
		- Limit a cv to two pages max
		- Including irrelevant info
		- Not showcasing personality
		- The days of the boring & plain CV's are dead
		- Consider graphs on your cv
		- Professional doesn't mean boring
		- Credentials only tell part of the story
	- Part Two: Building Blocks of a great cv:
		- Talking about chronological cv, which is most widely used and considered by employees
		- Use an immediate hook
		- Custom headlines allow you to frame the rest of your cv however you need
		- Get something accross very quickly
		- You might also consider a one-line headline that combines your title with an attention-grabbing phrase
		- Such as the following:
			- Job title with X years Experience doing this directly relevant thing
			- Job title who achieved this very impressive result
			- A mission statement in your industry / interest area
		- Achievements and accolades
		- Your objective shouldn't be about how fast or how things were done better
		- It should be about how you got it done
		- Ask yourself the following:
			- how much
			- how many
			- how often
			- how long
		- A strong narrative, ask yourself the following questions:
			- what's the narrative
			- whats the personal brand
			- what do you want them to really know
			- who are you, why is it important to them
			- what have you done to date
		- Three cs of personal branding:
			- consistency
			- creativity
			- credibility
		- Good formatting:
			- Don't send a word document cv
			- use simple fonts and spacing
			- Don't use tiny font, if someone has to squint to see it - it is going in the bin
			- Make sure somene proofreads it for you
			- carefully stand out get creative
			- don't reduce the margins
			- save it as a PDF and name it smartly
		- Great fit to the role:
			- A recruiters job is to make sure that you're a good match for that role.
			- use the language that they are using in the job advert
	- Part Three: Tailoring it to a job:
		- Dissecting jobs
		- what are they actually looking for?
		- Step 1: read and really understand the role:
			- Highlight the points that seem important
			- Think about why do they need help
			- what are the most important aspects that they are looking for
		- Step 2: make your first point immediately relevant:
			- Put your most relevant experience first
			- Even if that means grouping things slightly out of order
		- Step 3: revamp less relevant experience:
			- for less relevant experience
			- look for soft skills that are relevant to the role
		- Step 4: add in the benefit you created:
			- Ultimately, it's your accomplishments that make you stand out from all the applicatants
			- think about the benefits that you have done for a company
			- Ask yourself the following:
				- what did i do that was above and beyond
				- how did i stand out
				- was i ever recognised
				- what compliement did i recieve
				- what problems did i solve
			- Focus on the responsibility:
			- Focusing on the benefits
			- Adopt a supplier mindset vs customer mindset
			- Think about how you are going to benefit the company

					- look at an organisation's commitment to inclusive hiring before applying

				- focus on were you have gone above and beyond
			- question around putting dates:
				- Take off dates off of linkedin, in every day
